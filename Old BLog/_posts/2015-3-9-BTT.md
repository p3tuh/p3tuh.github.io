summary:    Forgot keyboard/trackpad shortcuts? Create your own!

My favorite efficiency tool on my Mac is [BetterTouchTools](http://www.bettertouchtool.net/), a powerful customization application which allows the user to essentially create their own keyboard shortcuts  trackpad gestures.  It also allows custom mouse, leap motion, apple remote, and application specific shortcuts.  

As a user of a 13" MacBook Pro with very limited screen real estate, I mostly use it for window management, particularly for window snapping. Window snapping resizes windows to a predetermined size instead of having to find the window edge, drag that edge to the preferred size, then do that to all the rest of your windows . Here are my window snapping settings: 
![snap](https://p3tuh.github.io/images/snapping.png)

CMD <- snaps the current window I am on to snap to the left half of the screen and I can CMD ->  to another window to snap to the right. This helps if I am comparing two windows such as reviewing my code against another code base I might find on stack overflow in my browser. 
![settings](https://p3tuh.github.io/images/snap-settings.png)

Window Snapping can also be initiated with the trackpad. With these settings I can drag a window the the left edge of the screen and it will snap it into the left half. If I drag it to the top left corner, It will snap it to the top left corner of the screen. I can then have four windows  split into equal four quadrants across the screen. 

Many power users have the trackpad gestures linked to custom keyboard shortcuts in specific applications such as three finger swipe scrolls through tabs in Chrome or SublimeText. This blog post barely hits the tip of the iceberg that is BetterTouchTools and you should explore how it can make you a more efficient osx user. 

<!-- All links are easy to [locate and discern](#), yet don't detract from the harmony
of a paragraph. The _same_ goes for italics and __bold__ elements. Even the the strikeout
works if <del>for some reason you need to update your post</del>. For consistency's sake,
<ins>The same goes for insertions</ins>, of course.

### Code, with syntax highlighting

Code blocks use the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme. Both the light and
dark versions are included, so you can swap them out easily. _Solarized Dark_ is the default.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Awesome < ActiveRecord::Base
  include EvenMoreAwesome

  validates_presence_of :something
  validates :email, email_format: true

  def initialize(email, name = nil)
    self.email = email
    self.name = name
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

# Headings!

They're responsive, and well-proportioned (in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).
They also heavily rely on the awesome utility, [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/).

##### They draw the perfect amount of attention

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.

### There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Potatoes
  * Milk

  1. Mow the lawn
  2. Feed the dog
  3. Dance

### Images look great, too

### There are also pretty colors

Also the result of [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/), you can <span class="bg-dark-gray white">highlight</span> certain components
of a <span class="red">post</span> <span class="mid-gray">with</span> <span class="green">CSS</span> <span class="orange">classes</span>.

I don't recommend using blue, though. It looks like a <span class="blue">link</span>.

### Stylish blockquotes included

You can use the markdown quote syntax, `>` for simple quotes.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse quis porta mauris.

However, you need to inject html if you'd like a citation footer. I will be working on a way to
hopefully sidestep this inconvenience.
