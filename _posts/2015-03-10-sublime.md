Fix the [Errno 2] when trying to use the sublime text console.log with node.

If you have followed method 2 from [this tutorial on sublime text console] (http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Javascript-Console-in-Sublime-Text) with node, and you're receiving the error : <span class="bg-dark-gray white">[Errno 2], the issue is that the path to node is incorrect in the custom build system you created. </span>

### Follow these steps: 
	1. Go to the following path via Finder: Macintosh HD ▸ Users ▸ "your username" ▸ Library ▸ Application Support ▸ Sublime Text 3 ▸ Packages ▸ User   (if "Library" is not visible in "your username" directory, hold option and click on "Go" in the finder menu to make the library folder unhidden)
	2. Open the file node.sublime-build in sublime text
	3. Edit the file to the following:
	{% highlight ruby %}
	{
		"cmd" ["/usr/local/bin/node", "$file"],
		"selector" : "source.js"
	}
	{% endhighlight %}
	4. Run a test by logging a message and save the file. Then press CMD + B.
	{% highlight ruby %}
		console.log("hello world")
	{% endhighlight %}
